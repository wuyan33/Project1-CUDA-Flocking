### Performance Measure
* Result GIFs on 5,000 boids:
  * Naive (by LICEcap):<br />
    <img src="/images/naive.gif" width="80%">
  * Uniform grid (by ScreenToGif):<br />
    <img src="/images/uniformGrid.gif" width="80%">
  * Coherent Search (by ScreenToGif):<br />
    <img src="/images/coherentSearch.gif" width="80%">
* Perform Analysis
  * Framerate change with increasing # of boids for naive, scattered uniform grid, and coherent uniform grid (with visualization): <br />
